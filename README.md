# Kodi Repository - Josh.5 Addons

Kodi Add-on Repository maintained by me, Josh.5

* Author: Josh Sunnex (jsunnex@gmail.com)

## Introduction
This repository contains a number of addons for Kodi and LibreELEC that simplify the way we interact and use Kodi.

## Installation
1. Download the [repository zip](repo/repository.josh5/repository.josh5-1.0.0.zip) 
and install it in Kodi.
2. Read the following [guide](http://wiki.Kodi.org/index.php?title=Add-ons#How_to_install_from_zip) 
on the Kodi wiki to learn how to install addons from a repository.

## F.A.Q.
### When I install the repository from ZIP file, Kodi complains that it "does not have the correct structure".
This has typically meant that you have downloaded this github repository as a ZIP file (by clicking on the
'Download as zip' button) in the downloads page. Instead, you need to download the repository from the link
in the 'Download Packages' section of the downloads page.

## Questions, Comments, Feature Requests or Issues
If you have any suggestions or feedback to make this repository even more awesome sauce then go ahead and submit an 
[issue](https://github.com/Josh5/repository.josh5/issues).
